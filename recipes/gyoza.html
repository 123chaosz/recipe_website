     <li>put the wrapper on the gyoza press and put about a tsp of the meat in the middle. spread the meat out 
        so it becomes like a flat circle. then dab a little water on the outer edge of the wrapper and close the press.</li>    
</ol>

<h2>cooking the gyoza</h2>

<ol><li>preheat a hot plate or carbon steel pan and then add cooking oil</li>
    <li>place the gyoza in the pan and cook until the bottom is seared</li>
    <li>add around 100-150ml of water to the pan and place a lid on the pan. cook until the water has evaporated and the starch from
        the wrappers has crisped and turned a golden brown color. </li>
